What good has this bundling done? How big is the new bundle file? Check the Chrome DevTools network log to see what files are being loaded.
Bundling has put all the files into one javascript file. It is about 6kb in size. The only things we created being loaded is bundle.js and the css file.

What role did Babel play in the bundling?
Bable makes sure it also bundles the react code as a preset.

Can you just load file:///pathâ€¦/index.html using the browser? Why or why not?
No, it will not be connected to the server so no new comments will be saved.

In webpack.config.js, what does the loader test entry test: /\.jsx?$/ do?
It initiates and throws an error message if the bundling to JS does not go as planned.
