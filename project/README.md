Hello Professor Vanderlinden,

For a project I would like to work on the museum holdings project proposal.

Museum Holdings — Professor VanAntwerp’s father works with the Pine River Area Historical Society 
and with their museum in Tustin, Michigan. They would like a catalog of holdings. Visitors to the 
museum could point to a QR code and get a short explanation of the object, its significance, links 
to other similar objects in the museum, and (perhaps) external links/documentation.

As for group partners I have no preference or qualms about whom I am working with. I would be okay	
with working with anyone.
