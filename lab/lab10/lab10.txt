Compare and contrast MongoDB and the SQL databases you’ve used before. Are there things that one can do that the other can’t?


You could run MongoDB locally. What advantages and/or disadvantages would that bring with respect to the cloud database you have now?
Running it locally would not update the cloud base we have but it would have greater speed.

You’ve built a “sandbox” database on mLab. Could you use this for a production database? Why or why not?
no, it is limited in the amount it can do.


For this integration of mLab into your application, was it better to run the modified server (npm start) or the full Webpack development environment (npm run dev)? Why?
It was better to run npm start as the server did not need changing on the client side once it was up.

Explain what happens when you modify the database using mLab’s web interface rather than your application? Try adding/updating/deleting comment documents.
It changes the web application display in response and is saved into the database.

Is this comments application the sort of application that should use an SQL or a noSQL database? Explain your answer.
NoSQL, it is easier to edit and deal with
