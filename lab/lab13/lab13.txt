What benefit did using the React Router bring to the application?
This gave us the ability to navigate the app with the history buttons

Which is better, hash history or browser history?
Depends on the situation but in our case browser.

Why does the server (either Webpack Dev Server or the Express server) have to be modified to support the browser history? Compare this with the hash-based server demonstrated in class, which didn't require such modifications.
Because otherwise it will leave the application looking for the last address outside of the one you are on

What state does the new CommentEdit component maintain and how does that compare with the state maintained by the CommentBox component?
CommentEdit maintains the ID of a comment in commentBox

What does the CommentEdit component do when the AJAX PUT or DELETE methods return successfully? How does this compare with what the “Cancel” button provided by the CommentEdit component does?
It updates the comment, if hit cancel it does not update the component

How is the Link added in the last step different from a simple HTML hyperlink?
This link takes us through our router using the comment id to edit said comment
